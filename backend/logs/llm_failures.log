    "reasoning": "This case is highly complex due to several factors. It involves a request for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which inherently entails a multi-national procedural framework, potential involvement of various EU institutions and Member States, and a lengthy timeline (typically 1.5-2+ years). The subject matter is the interpretation of highly technical EU financial services regulation (PRIIPs), specifically concerning pricing methodologies for investment products. The question itself delves into a nuanced aspect of how 'pricing frequency' relates to the recency of underlying asset valuations, which can be a novel and intricate legal point. The language of the case is German, adding a layer of translation for the CJEU.",
